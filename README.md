# dbgoat
A simple interface for managing databases

dbgoat will give you freedom and low level access to your database and will only
provide basic abstractions for common operations in most database engines,
such as:

- Easily create, delete, rename, export, backup databases
- Submit commands to modify or read data from your database

The goal of dbgoat is to make management so easy, that a database becomes
as simple as using a variable in modern programming languages.


Supported database engines:
- MySQL

More databases will be supported in the future ðŸ˜Ž
